# Robustness-Learning-Notes

## 1908--
* Vision
  * [HXY] 
* Uncertainty
  * [HXY] On Calibration of Modern Neural Networks ([ICML'17](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04599)) ([Non-official Code](https://github.com/gpleiss/temperature_scaling)). 
    1) Metrics: ECE, MCE. 
    2) Methods: histogram binning and its variants, Platt scaling/Temperature scaling. 
    3) Factors of miscalibrated: model capacity, regularization. 
    4) NLL
  * [HXY] To Trust Or Not To Trust A Classifier ([NIPS'18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11783)) ([scikit-learn Code]( https://github.com/google/TrustScore)). leverage KNN to measure whether the classification result is trustworthy.
* Privacy
  * [HXY] Scalable Private Learning with PATE ([ICLR'18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08908)) ([Official Tensorflow Code](https://github.com/tensorflow/privacy)). 
     1) Differential privacy. 
     2) PATE: disjoint data for teachers, Laplacian noise added to each class of the teachers' vote histogram, leverage public unlabeled data to train student. 
     3) Scalable PATE: Gaussian noise (more centralized in more classes case), only samples with strong consensus in teachers are leaked to the student,  samples where student confidently agrees with teachers are discarded (can't help learning).

## 190812
* Vision
  * [YJC] Meta-SR: A Magnification-Arbitrary Network for Super-Resolution ([CVPR'19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00875)): very bad writing...
  * [YJC] Gradient Harmonized Single-stage Detector ([AAAI'19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05181)): it seems a good and effective paper. Surprisingly effective on my dataset.
  * [YJC] Deep Layer Aggregation ([CVPR'18](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Yu_Deep_Layer_Aggregation_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf))
  * [HXY] Understanding and Improving Convolutional Neural Networks via Concatenated Rectified Linear Units ([ICML'16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05201))
* Uncertainty
    - [HXY] Training Confidence-calibrated Classifiers for Detecting Out-of-Distribution Samples
 ([ICLR'18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09325)) ([Official PyTorch Code](https://github.com/alinlab/Confident_classifier))
    - [HXY] Attacks Meet Interpretability: Attribute-steered Detection of Adversarial Samples ([NIPS'18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11580)) ([Official Caffe Code](https://github.com/AmIAttribute/AmI))
    * [YJC] Direct Uncertainty Prediction for Medical Second Opinions ([ICML'19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01771)) ([Supp](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/raghu19a/raghu19a-supp.pdf)): it is not an easy-to-follow paper, though the core idea is very simple... it needs ground truth disagreement. It does not well leverage the classification and uncertainty prediction task (joint training drops the performance). Anyway, it is not easy to follow, thus I did not read all the experiment part.

## 190806
* Ambiguity

    - [YJC] PHiSeg: Capturing Uncertainty in Medical Image Segmentation ([MICCAI'19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04045)) ([code](https://github.com/baumgach/PHiSeg-code)): good results, enhanced Prob-UNet. Multi-scale prior encoding for ambiguous segmentation.
